I have to import all JavaSript files at once in index.html which means that
you can access variables from other files and this not a good practice

Can't require js files and group them in one index.js file 

Can't create a class for controller since can't use a function inside a class, i have to figure out 
how it can be done such as wrapping functions where i instantiate the controller class

note: we can create a seperate domains folder where each domain contains business logic, services
specific entities related to the domain. In this case the interaction will take place between the 
controller and the domain
